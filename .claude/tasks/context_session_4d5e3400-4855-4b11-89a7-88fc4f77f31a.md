## Project Overview
ABsmartly SDK Plugins - Collection of plugins for ABsmartly JavaScript SDK

## Current Task
User asking about CDN bundling configuration - whether all plugins are bundled in dist dir for use via unpkg/CDN

## Findings
- Package has multiple bundle outputs in the `dist` directory
- Current bundles (as of package.json v1.1.3):
  - `absmartly-sdk-plugins.min.js` (all plugins)
  - `absmartly-dom-changes-core.min.js` (DOM only)
  - `absmartly-dom-changes-lite.min.js` (DOM lite)
  - `absmartly-cookie.min.js` (cookie only)
  - `absmartly-vitals.min.js` (vitals only)
  - `absmartly-overrides-lite.min.js` (overrides lite)
  - `absmartly-overrides-full.min.js` (overrides full)
- Uses webpack for bundling with different BUILD_TYPE env variables
- Browser field in package.json points to: `dist/absmartly-sdk-plugins.min.js`

## Work Done
- Reviewed package.json structure and build scripts
- Checked dist directory contents
- Reading webpack configuration to understand bundling setup
