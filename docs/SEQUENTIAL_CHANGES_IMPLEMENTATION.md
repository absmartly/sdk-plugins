# Sequential Changes Implementation

## Date: 2025-09-06

## Summary
Successfully implemented support for multiple sequential DOM changes with the same selector and type, ensuring changes can be applied in order and may depend on previous changes.

## Key Requirements Met

✅ **Multiple changes for same selector+type**: The plugin now correctly handles multiple changes of the same type for the same selector
✅ **Sequential application**: Changes are applied in the order they are passed
✅ **Dependent changes**: Changes can build on previous changes (e.g., text transformations)
✅ **Proper restoration**: When removing changes, elements are restored to their true original state

## Implementation Details

### 1. Sequential Change Application
- Changes are applied using the `applyChangeToElement` helper method
- Each change is tracked in the order it was applied
- Multiple changes of the same type for the same selector are all stored

### 2. Original State Management
The key insight was that original state should be captured ONCE per selector+type combination:
- First change captures the true original state
- Subsequent changes of the same type don't overwrite the original state
- This ensures proper restoration to the initial state

### 3. Critical Bug Fixes

#### Bug 1: Style Property Conversion
**Problem**: CSS properties in camelCase weren't being applied correctly
**Solution**: Convert camelCase to kebab-case when applying styles
```typescript
const cssProperty = property.replace(/([A-Z])/g, '-$1').toLowerCase();
```

#### Bug 2: Attribute Restoration Conflict
**Problem**: Attribute restoration was removing ALL attributes, including those managed by other change types (style, class)
**Solution**: 
- When storing original attributes, skip style and class attributes
- When restoring, only remove attributes not managed by other change types

#### Bug 3: Move Case Syntax Error
**Problem**: Orphaned case statement for 'move' type
**Solution**: Integrated move handling into the if-else chain

## Test Coverage

Created comprehensive test suite (`DOMManipulator.sequential.test.ts`) with 10 tests covering:
- Multiple text changes sequentially
- Dependent changes that build on each other
- Multiple style changes sequentially
- Multiple class changes sequentially
- Restoration to original state
- Removing specific changes
- Multiple elements with same selector
- Mixed change types for same selector
- Progressive text transformations
- Incremental style building

All tests pass ✅

## Example Usage

```javascript
// Apply multiple sequential changes
plugin.applyChange({
  selector: '.button',
  type: 'text',
  value: 'First Change'
}, 'exp1');

plugin.applyChange({
  selector: '.button',
  type: 'text',
  value: 'Second Change - builds on first'
}, 'exp1');

plugin.applyChange({
  selector: '.button',
  type: 'style',
  value: { color: 'red', fontSize: '20px' }
}, 'exp1');

// All changes are tracked and applied sequentially
// Element will have:
// - Text: "Second Change - builds on first"
// - Style: color: red; font-size: 20px;

// Remove all changes - restores to original state
plugin.removeChanges('exp1');
```

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Clean Separation**: Plugin remains unaware of extensions or preview modes
2. **Predictable Behavior**: Changes are always applied in order
3. **Proper State Management**: Original state is preserved correctly
4. **No Conflicts**: Different change types (style, class, attribute) don't interfere with each other

## Files Modified

1. `src/core/DOMManipulator.ts`
   - Added `applyChangeToElement` helper method
   - Fixed style property conversion
   - Fixed attribute restoration logic
   - Fixed move case syntax error

2. `src/core/StateManager.ts`
   - Fixed attribute storage to exclude style/class attributes

3. `src/core/__tests__/DOMManipulator.sequential.test.ts`
   - New comprehensive test suite for sequential changes

## Undo/Redo Architecture

Also documented the recommended approach for undo/redo functionality:
- Should be implemented in the extension, not the plugin
- Extension maintains history stack
- Plugin provides all necessary APIs for undo/redo
- See `UNDO_REDO_ARCHITECTURE.md` for details

## Conclusion

The plugin now properly supports multiple sequential changes as requested. The implementation is clean, well-tested, and maintains the separation of concerns established in the clean architecture refactor.
